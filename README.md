# What is Linux ?

Linux is an operating system, a computer science student (Linus Torvalds) wanted to create a free alternative to Unix, which was a popular operating system at the time but was expensive and proprietary. Linus began working on his project, and in 1991, he released the first version of Linux as a hobby project.

Linus made Linux open-source, meaning he shared the code with everyone, allowing other programmers to contribute and improve it. This collaborative effort led to rapid development and improvements.

As more people contributed to Linux, it became more powerful and versatile. It gained popularity among developers and eventually started being used in businesses and even on personal computers.

Today, Linux is everywhere! It powers servers, supercomputers, smartphones, and even appliances like routers and smart TVs. Its flexibility, stability, and cost-effectiveness make it a popular choice for all sorts of computing needs.
