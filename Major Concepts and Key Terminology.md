# Concepts and Key Terminology? 


- **Linux** : is an open-source operating system kernel initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is the core component of many different Linux distributions, which are complete operating systems based on the Linux kernel.

- **GNU**  : is a project that aims to create a free and open-source operating system similar to Unix. It offers a collection of software tools and utilities that allow users to run, modify, and distribute software freely. While GNU provides many essential components, it initially lacked a kernel, which was later provided by the Linux kernel, resulting in the widely used operating system known as GNU/Linux.

- **Kernel** : is the essential part of an operating system that manages communication between hardware and software. It controls tasks like memory management, process scheduling, and device communication. Essentially, it's the core software that keeps your computer running smoothly.

- **Shell** : is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the operating system, allowing users to interact with the computer through commands. It interprets commands entered by the user and executes them by communicating with the operating system's kernel. In simpler terms, it's like a command interpreter that helps users navigate and control their computer using text-based commands.

- **Terminal** : is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system. It provides a command-line environment where users can enter commands to perform tasks, manage files, and execute programs.

- **File system** : is a method used by computers to organize and store data on storage devices like hard drives and SSDs. It manages how data is stored, retrieved, and organized into files and directories.
